# UFOs

## Overview of Project
Create a website to showcase UFO sightings, provide a data table and add table filter elements so that users can filter for multiple criteria. Filters include date, city, state, country and shape.

## Results
A user can type an entry in any field listed below to find table entries that exactly match all fields entered. No button is needed, the table will filter automatically.

See example below for the entries 1/1/2010, el cajon, and ca:

## Summary
The drawback to these filter inputs is that the are case sensitive and require and exact match. Adding to many filters can return no results. I would recommend allowing for mixed case entries and non-exact matches. I would also recommend cleaning the table data since there seem to be some code elements mixed in (#33&#33, &#44 etc...)
